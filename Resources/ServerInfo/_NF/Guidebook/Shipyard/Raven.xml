  ## Sidenotes

  - Raven-class shuttles are equipped with two wallmount substations (one in Engineering, one on the Bridge) and three APC units (one outside Engineering, one in the mess corridor, one on the Bridge). Consult the Power Monitoring Computer on the Bridge for exact locations.
  - Power consumption chart for an unmodified Raven-class shuttle:
  -- 30 kW with full SMES units
  -- 44 kW with one empty SMES unit
  -- 69 kW with two empty SMES units
  -- 90 kW with two empty SMES units and empty substations
