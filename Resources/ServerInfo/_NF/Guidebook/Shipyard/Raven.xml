  ## Sidenotes

  - Raven-class shuttles are equipped with two wallmount substations (one in Engineering, one on the Bridge) and three APC units (one outside Engineering, one in the mess corridor, one on the Bridge). Consult the Power Monitoring Computer on the Bridge for exact locations.
  - Power consumption chart for an unmodified Raven-class shuttle:
  -- 35 kW with a full SMES unit
  -- 40 kW with an empty SMES unit
  -- 65 kW with an empty SMES unit, empty substations and empty APC units
